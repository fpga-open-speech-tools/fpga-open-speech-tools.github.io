            <p>
                Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are very powerful processing devices that can process data
                rapidly in parallel and with deterministic latency, however designing algorithms for these devices can
                be challenging. FPGA Open Speech Tools is a project that is designed to help make development of audio
                signal processing algorithms for FPGAs more accessible and efficient. This involves the creation of both
                new hardware and software for developers to use. The hardware side of the project consists of both a
                low-cost and high-performance platform. The low-cost platform is designed to be used by hobbyists and in
                the classroom while the high-performace platfrom is designed for use in a research setting.
            </p>
            <p>
                The software side of the project consists of an autogeneration tool that addresses the inherent
                difficulty in developing for FPGAs and a web-based application to make user interactions with the
                hardware much more convenient. The autogeneration tool uses Mathworksâ€™ Simulink to build complex audio
                processing systems with MATLAB, a programming language that is very accessible, sythesize the design
                into a VHLD component, and build Linux loadable kernel modules for the VHDL component to control its
                adjustable parameters at runtime. The autogeneration tool also streamlines the construction and
                compilation of the Quartus project, which creates the bitstream used to program the FPGA. The code
                generation tool also creates several interface files used by a web-based application to interact with
                the algorithms running on the FPGA.
