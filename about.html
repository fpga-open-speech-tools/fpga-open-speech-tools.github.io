            <p>
              Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are very powerful processing devices that can 
              process data rapidly in parallel and with deterministic latency, however designing 
              algorithms for these devices can be challenging. FPGA Open Speech Tools is a project 
              that is designed to help make development of audio signal processing algorithms for 
              FPGAs more accessible and efficient. This involves the creation of both new hardware 
              and software for developers to use. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Two hardware platforms are currently being developed.  The first is a low-cost platform 
              based on the Altera DE10-Nano, called the Audio Mini. This platform is intended to be 
              used by hobbyists and in the classroom to create custom audio processing projects.  
              The high-performance platform, called the Audio Blade, is designed for use in a research 
              setting.  Unlike the Audio Mini which has two interfaces, this platform has eight audio 
              interfaces.  These include microphone in, headphone out, line in and out, high-speed audio 
              in and out, as well as a microphone array input and speaker array output.
            </p>
            <p>
              Development on FPGAs can be difficult and time consuming, so we are currently developing 
              an autogeneration tool to help mitigate these problems.  The autogeneration tool uses 
              Mathworksâ€™ Simulink to build complex audio processing systems with MATLAB, a programming 
              language that is very accessible, synthesize the design into a VHLD component, and build 
              Linux loadable kernel modules for the VHDL component to control its adjustable parameters 
              at runtime. The autogeneration tool also streamlines the construction and compilation of a 
              complete Quartus project, which creates the bitstream used to program the FPGA.            
            </p>
            <p>
              The loadable kernel modules can be accessed through the command line on the embedded hard 
              processor system (HPS), however this is inconvenient for any practical application.  
              Therefore, we are also developing a web-based application that can easily interface with 
              these drivers at runtime.  This unique, innovative app uses configuration files created 
              by the autogeneration tool to render custom interfaces at runtime.  Furthermore, these 
              configuration files can either be present on the device on boot-up or downloaded, using 
              the app, from a cloud service like Amazon Web Services.              
            </p>
            <p>
              Several example projects for each platform are currently being developed as well.  The 
              most basic projects are simple pass throughs, in which audio is simply passed unmodified 
              from input to output, which serve as reference designs.  Other example projects include 
              simple hearing aids, audio effects processors, and delay-and-sum beamformers.             
            </p>
